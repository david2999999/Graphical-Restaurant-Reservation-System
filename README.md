## Graphical Restaurant Reservation System
A reservation system for pubs and restaurants that would allow you to see 
a graphical layout of the establishment. You would see what tables are available 
at what times and you'd be able to book a specific table for a specific time. You
 could do it on the web or using a mobile app without needing to call the restaurant.
  You can pick your seats on a plane, why not a restaurant?
